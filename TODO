Things to do: 

Frontend:
 - Lets try get basic mockups done, we can do something netflix style. Question: Should the images be stored in a db? or just statically in a folder or something?
 - User logon/logoff/create page
 - Marketplace page
 - Checkout

Backend:
 - Basic flask app (##There are some issues since I am not completely aware of the way html files work. But I think I shoud be able to figure it out soon. Also, I have put in a salting function which I found on a website. We could not use it we want.)
 - Successful persistence to a db
 - User logon/logoff/create backend functionality
 - Marketplace data (basic items + pricing, etc)
 - Stripe connectivity (not sure how yet but we can read up on how this works)
